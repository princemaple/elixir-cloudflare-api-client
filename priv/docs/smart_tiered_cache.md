# Smart Tiered Cache

## Patch Smart Tiered Cache setting

**PATCH** `/zones/{zone_id}/cache/tiered_cache_smart_topology_enable`

Smart Tiered Cache dynamically selects the single closest upper tier for each of your website’s origins with no configuration required, using our in-house performance and routing data. Cloudflare collects latency data for each request to an origin, and uses the latency data to determine how well any upper-tier data center is connected with an origin. As a result, Cloudflare can select the data center with the lowest latency to be the upper-tier for an origin.
